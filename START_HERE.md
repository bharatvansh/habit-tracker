## 🤔 Common Questions

### Q: Which feature should I build first?
**A:** If you can only build ONE thing: **Habit DNA™**. It's the most unique and shareable.

### Q: How long will this all take?
**A:** 
- Top 3 features: 6-8 weeks
- Full vision: 16-20 weeks

### Q: What if I'm a solo developer?
**A:** Focus on initial features first (Week 1-2), then DNA (Week 3-4). Get feedback before building more.

### Q: Should I hire a designer?
**A:** Yes, for DNA visualization. The visual quality matters for shareability. Budget $1,000-2,000 for quality work.

### Q: What about marketing?
**A:** DNA is self-marketing (shareable). Focus on Product Hunt launch and Reddit communities. See COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS.md for full strategy.

### Q: How do I prioritize features?
**A:** Use this formula: `Impact × Uniqueness ÷ Effort`. DNA scores highest.

### Q: What if a competitor copies our features?
**A:** DNA requires complex implementation. By the time they copy, you'll be the original. First-mover advantage + network effects = moat.

## 📞 Final Thoughts

You have a solid foundation with Habitual. These improvements will transform it from "another habit tracker" to **"the intelligent habit tracker with DNA"** - a unique position in a crowded market.

### The Key Insight

**Habitual can be different:**

- It **understands** you (Relationship Network)

This isn't just habit tracking. It's habit intelligence.

### The Opportunity

- No clear category leader yet
- Users frustrated with current options
- Perfect timing for innovation

### The Path Forward
1. Build DNA (your moat)
2. Remove guilt (Miss Intelligence)
3. Show impact (tangible progress)
4. Tell the world (it's shareable by design)
5. Dominate the market
